            <h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
            
            <p><em>Lorem ipsum</em> is a pseudo-Latin text used in web design, typography, layout, and printing in place of the actual text to emphasise design elements over content. It is also called placeholder (or filler) text. It’s a convenient tool for mock-ups and helps to outline the visual elements of a document or presentation, e.g. typography, font, or layout.</p>

            <h1>Where Does Lorem Ipsum Come From?</h1>
            
            <p><em>Lorem ipsum</em> is mostly a part of sections of the Latin text <em>De finibus bonorum et malorum</em> by the classical author and philosopher Cicero. Its words and letters have been changed by addition or removal, so to deliberately render its content nonsensical; it’s not genuine, correct, or comprehensible Latin anymore.</p>
